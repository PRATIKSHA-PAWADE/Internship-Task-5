Employee Attrition Analysis Using Data Visualization
This project explores employee attrition patterns through multiple visualizations using Pythonâ€™s Seaborn and Matplotlib libraries. By analyzing key factors such as business travel, department, distance from home, job satisfaction, monthly income, and gender, the notebook highlights trends that influence employee turnover.
Data Preparation

Imported employee data into a Pandas DataFrame (at).

Cleaned and filtered columns relevant to attrition.

Visualization

Created count plots, bar plots, pie charts, box plots, point plots, violin plots, and joint plots to explore relationships between employee attributes and attrition.

Analysis

Compared attrition trends across business travel categories, departments, genders, job satisfaction levels, and income levels.

Investigated correlations between numeric variables like DistanceFromHome and MonthlyIncome with attrition.

Insights Extraction

Identified patterns that may indicate higher attrition risk groups.
Key Findings

Employees with frequent business travel or low job satisfaction show higher attrition rates.

Certain departments have higher turnover compared to others.

Income and distance from home influence attrition; low income and longer commutes correlate with higher attrition.

Visualizations highlight which groups may require targeted retention strategies.
